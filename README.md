# unit-4-game

Objective of the game is to match the computer guess by clicking on the crystals.

For this game, I used a little of bit of bootstrap, javaScript, jQuery, css, and old school html techniques. 

You will be able to observe the old school technique on the images in the html. I just felt it gave me better control over them.
